D-Light
-------
An educational iOS app aimed at teaching children aged 6-10 years old how much
sunlight they need a day to get enough vitamin D, without being in the sun for
too long, and where they can find alternative sources of the vitamin in the
absence of adequate sunlight.
The app aims to convey this information through a series of colourful scenarios
with a series of decisions, ultimately leading to the success or demise of
the character's arch nemesis, Dr Dastardly.
